# SVG-to-Painter2D-for-Unity

SVGs render horribly without antialiasing and PNG graphics render too blurry when being scaled in Unity's UI Toolkit. Rendering vector shapes with the Painter2D class allows us to define shapes in a similar way to SVGs while rendering them with full antialiasing.

This is a tool for converting SVG files to Painter2D code.
