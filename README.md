# SVG-to-Painter2D-for-Unity

In Unity UI Toolkit SVGs render horribly without antialiasing and PNG graphics render too blurry when being scaled at non-original sizes. Rendering vector shapes with the Painter2D class allows us to define shapes in a similar way to SVGs while rendering them with full antialiasing.

This is a tool for converting SVG files to Painter2D code.
